# About the flow of the program
The program runs all tests using the solveAllTests() method, and then each test
with the solveOneTest() method. For each test, a unique database is initialized
using the Singleton Pattern. Data is read into the database from the test
input file using the java org.json library.

The data input is adapted from the example given in Tema1 project skeleton at
https://github.com/oop-pub/oop-asignments/tree/master/teme/tema .

For each test, the simulation iterates over each year. For the first year, the
data is checked as to not contain adults in the children list, removing them.
For every other year, the new data is added to the database using the
SimulationUpdater class.

When introducing the new gift preferences for each child, care is taken so that
the elements in the new preferences list are not duplicated. I have chosen to
use ArrayList for this data structure and not a LinkedHashSet because of the
need to introduce elements at specific indexes in the list.

For each year, the average nice score for each child is calculated using the
NiceScoreCalculator class. Each child is given a Strategy for determining
the average score based on their age, and this strategy is created using
a Factory class. Then the budget is assigned using the BudgetCalculator class.

Assigning gifts to children is done using the GiftGiver class, which implements
the logic given in the requirements.
